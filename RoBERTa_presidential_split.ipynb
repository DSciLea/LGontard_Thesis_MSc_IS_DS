public private partnerships. the usaid tb program implementation principles were guided by the ndoh strategies such as the national strategic plan on hiv, stis, and tb 2007 2011, later 20122016 and the ndoh negotiated service delivery agreement nsda output 3 which is combating hiv and aids, decreasing the burden of disease from tuberculosis to realize the sa governments vision in the nsda of a long and a healthy life for all south africans as well as the stop tb strategy. drug resistant tuberculosis drtb is a global public health crisis that threatens to undermine tb control efforts in many countries. south africa currently has the fifth highest burden of mdrtb in the world, with 15,400 diagnosed cases in 2012. approximately 10 of these mdrtb cases were reported to have extensively drug resistant tb xdrtb. the usaid tb program south africa has been supporting the ndoh in combating drtb in the country through expanding access to diagnostics, improving programmatic management of mdrtb at community level, and increasing provider capacity at all levels to implement drtb programs. to improve tb diagnostics, the usaid tb program south africa partnered closely with the ndoh to facilitate the genexpert roll out in march 2011. through substantial political support and government investment, south africa now has 289 genexpert machines placed throughout the country. the usaid tb program south africa trained 916 technical and 3968 clinical staff on the use of the genexpert machines. the decentralization of the drtb program supported by the usaid tb program has resulted in an increased number of patients on treatment. to provide support for those patients who fail treatment, the usaid tb program, in consultation with the ndoh, developed a strategy to promote palliative care for incurable mdrxdrtb patients. executive summary the usaid tb program has been successful in steadily scaling up art uptake across its 24 supported districts and subdistricts. art uptake among coinfected tbhiv patients in project supported districts rose from 43.0 in januarymarch 2012 to a high of 72.6 in apriljune 2014. to promote case detection and treatment of tb among children, the project launched a campaign to raise awareness of the issue of childhood tb, as well as provided tools to health care workers to help them screen, identify, and treatment pediatric tb cases. the usaid tb program south africa managed a robust portfolio of advocacy, communication, and social mobilization acsm activities to raise awareness on tbrelated issues and increase demand for tb services supported by communitybased organizations funded throughout the country. the project supported mass media campaigns through tv public service announcements psas tb messaging through popular tv shows and radio dramas radio psas radio talk shows and interviews dissemination of periodical usaid tb program south africa 20092015 2 usaid tb program south africa 20092015 2 press releases to newspapers, journals, magazines, and other publications and information, education, and communication iec materials such as pamphlets, fact sheets, and posters, widely distributed to health facilities, ngos, faith based organizations fbos, sports clubs, health facilities, schools, taxi ranks, bus stops and libraries. the project used mass media to raise awareness on the symptoms of tb and hiv to the general public, encourage them to test early, and ultimately reduce transmission of tb through proper infection control. tb psas aired on tv and radio to reach wide general audiences with tb messages. over the life of the project, 72 of black south african adults ages 1664 and 62 of children ages 514 have been reached by tv psas, while 64 of adults and 49 of children have been reached by radio spots. in partnership with the ndoh, the usaid tb program south africa developed a national tb awareness campaign called we beat tb. the campaign targeted adult south africans ages 1664 and school aged children. promotion materials featuring the we beat tb campaign brand are distributed at community mobilization activities, health education sessions, and national events such as world tb day and world aids day. to improve tb prevention and expand dots in communities, the usaid tb program south africa awarded 91 grants to 75 communitybased organizations throughout south africas nine provinces. grants were given to local communitybased organizations cbos and fbos with the purpose of building their capacity in tb prevention and support. park homes were procured and installed to be used as an addition to existing health facilities in eastern cape, kwazulunatal, and mpumalanga to improve the infrastructure capacity to deliver quality tb services. the park homes addressed implementation challenges such as high case load and improve infection control and improve integration of tb hiv services. the usaid tb program south africa adopted a publicprivate mix ppm approach to addressing tb and expanding dots in the private sector through engaging traditional health practitioners thps. thps were capitated in supporting active case finding, identifying tb symptoms early and refer timeously to health facilities in limpopo, kwazulunatal and free state. south africas more than 500,000 mine workers currently have the highest rates of tb in the world, and most of these miners are migrant workers from neighbouring countries, lesotho, mozambique, and swaziland, resulting in a huge threat of crossborder spread. the usaid tb programs support for improving tb services within the mining sector focused on developing lasting multisectoral partnerships geared to promote advocacy and consensus building among mine operators, mine health services, mine laborers representatives, and district department of health on practical steps to implement the objectives within the declaration on tb in the mining sector, a legal instrument, signed by 15 heads of state at the summit meeting of the southern african development community sadc in august 2012. final report 3 summary of key achievements contributed to better tb outcomes, in terms of improved treatment success rates, loss to follow up rates, and tb screening among hiv patients in projectsupported districts. on basic tb management, mdrtb, and tbhiv trained 19,167 hcws including 917 doctors expanded access to tb services among vulnerable and hardtoreach populations, including people living with hiv, mine workers, and children. awarded 91 grants to 75 community based organizations throughout south africas nine provinces and worked with these organizations to build their capacity to sustain the ongoing fight against tb. 91 grants supported decentralization of the drtb treatment programs throughout the country, resulting in an increased number of drtb patients on treatment. increased art uptake among coinfected tbhiv patients in projectsupported districts involved privatesector partners in tb control efforts, which led to more than 11,033 cases cases of tb being diagnosed by the nondoh sector 43 72.6 usaid tb program south africa 20092015 4 usaid tb program south africa 20092015 4 context and program rationale globally, more than nine million people become ill with tuberculosis tb each year, and more than 1.5 million die of the disease. south africa is classified by the world health organization who as a high burden tb, hiv and multidrug resistant tb mdrtb country. the country has the worlds third highest tb burden, with nearly half a million incident cases each year or approximately one out of every 100 south africans. twothirds 6065 of tested tb patients are found to be hivpositive and south africa has some of the highest incidence of mdrtb and extremelydrug resistant tb xdrtb in the world. the usaid tb program south africa was a 5year project 20092014 implemented by university research co., llc urc. this project built on the successes of the previous usaid tasc ii tb project 20042009, also implemented by urc. program goals and objectives the usaid tb program south africa supported the national department of health ndoh in improving early case detection, increasing access to diagnostics, ensuring treatment support for patients on tb treatment and ensuring that there was provision of appropriate and timely hiv care for tb patients and art treatment for all tbhiv coinfected patients. the usaid tb program developed multi level support, working closely with the national tb control program ntp to build national support by mobilizing resources and creating a conducive environment for expansion of tb services, as well as, with provincial and district health departments to support the collaborative development of needbased strategies to combat tb, tbhiv and drug resistant dr tb, and with communities to create appropriate social mobilization and service delivery models for rapid expansion of directly observed treatment shortcourse dots in the country. expected results from this program included u a national tb treatment success rate of 80. u improved capacity to plan and implement tb dots at community, facility, district, municipality, provincial and national levels. u improved surveillance system resulting in early detection of tb cases, mdrtb cases, coinfected patients for art as well as to prevent

the usaid tb program south africa assisted the ndoh to implement and actualize the six components of the stop tb strategy, which included 1 pursuing highquality dots expansion and enhancement 2 addressing tbhiv, mdrtb, and the needs of poor and vulnerable populations 3 contributing to health systems strengthening hss based on primary health care phc 4 engaging all care providers 5 empowering people with tb, and communities through partnerships and 6 enabling and promoting research. since it was adopted in may 2014, the tb program has also supported the ndoh to work toward the post2015 stop tb strategy to reduce tb deaths by 95 and cut new cases by 90 by 2035. patientcentered care the usaid tb program south africa worked to improve the content of care, through development of and training on evidencedbased national guidelines and treatment protocols the process of care, through quality improvement qi strategies designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of systems and the context of care, through support for communitybased social support and counseling services. working as a handinglove technical assistance partner to the doh the usaid tb program south africa sought to build the longterm capacity of the doh to effectively and sustainably implement its national tb control programme. the project received unprecedented acclaim, praise, and recognition for its

urc was widely applauded for their high level of technical expertise in tb, bottomup approach, responsiveness, and support to the doh, both in capacity building and skills transfer as well as in systems building.  usaid evaluation report 2014 usaid program evaluation, 100 of doh respondents praised the project for its close and collaborative relations with the doh, as well as its bottomup approach. in many emerging areas of tb, the usaid tb program worked to expand the national dialogue among key stakeholders. this included support for the national tb think tank, hosting a national diagnostics summit, and many others. decentralized treatment tb program south africa promoted the ndoh policy directive, a shift away from clinicallyfocused, hospital based mdrtb treatment toward programmatic management and communitybased care for mdrtb patients. this model reduces hospital caseloads and delays in treatment initiation, reduced inpatient costs, and allows patients to receive sustained family and community support during their treatment. vulnerable populations the usaid tb program worked with dohs to expand services to specific vulnerable and hardtoreach groups. this included expanding services in large townships, developing strategies to reach workers in the mining sector, addressing the issue of tb among women and children, and funding one of the programs small grantees to address tb in prisons. innovations the usaid tb program introduced a number of innovative evidencebased tools for improved patient as well as program management. the usaid tb program piloted mhealth applications for identifying clustering of tbmdrtb patients and also developed a module for mdrtb patient management that will be rolled out as part of the proof of concept. since march 2011, the usaid tb program has supported the ndoh in its nationwide rollout of xpert mtbrif testing as the firstline test for all suspected tb cases. operations research the usaid tb program supported the design of targeted research to help answer key operational questions to improve tb management systems. for example, the project funded the desmond tutu tb centre to evaluate how to improve tb case reporting among children. program focus areas improving the quality of tb services u working with the ndoh, provinces, districts, and other stakeholders to develop and implement

south africa has assisted the ndoh in making a number of improvements to national tb policies and guidelines to improve access to and use of health services and improve management of tb in health facilities. as technical assistance partner to the doh, the usaid tb program south africa designed a number of tools and toolkits to assist facility managers, health care workers, and community health workers to deliver high quality tb prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services. many of the tools have been formally adopted and disseminated by the doh, and are being used by partner organizations throughout the country. these tools include the genexpert training manual, clinical dr training manual, tb and drtb patient registers, traditional health practitioners screening and referral tool, tb screening tool for adults and children, tbhiv facility data collection tool, drtb treatment care, ipt patient treatment card, and daily tb diary. diagnostics lack of diagnostic capacity has been a significant barrier in preventing an effective response to tb epidemic worldwide. according to the who global tuberculosis report 2012, a highquality laboratory system that uses modern diagnostics is a prerequisite for early, rapid and accurate detection of tb. inadequacies in laboratory capacity in many low and middle income countries have been cited as part of the reason why only 66 of the estimated 8.7 million tb cases in 2011 were diagnosed and notified by national tb control programs. the usaid tb program supported the ndoh to expand access to rapid, highquality diagnostics so that tb patients are initiated on treatment sooner, raising their chance of being cured and reducing the risk of spreading tb to others. mapping and identifying gaps in laboratory systems the usaid tb program south africa undertook a desk survey in 2010 to identify preliminary challenges with the countrys project activities and key results in 2011, the tb program south africa used the fdic and ldic tools to conduct a rapid appraisal of 22 facilities in mafikeng district and 10 facilities in ventersdorp district of northwest province in response to the poor performance of the provinces tb program. the assessment revealed a lack of tb registers in some facilities and poor recording and updating of results in others. these results informed the development of tailored interventions to help the facilities address their diagnostic challenges. laboratory system. some of the challenges identified included prolonged sputum turnaround time tat, problems in cold chain maintenance during the transportation of specimens and insufficient access to laboratories by the clinics and screening sites. the next year, 2011 in partnership with the national health laboratory service nhls, the program mapped all the tb microscopy diagnostic centers in the country to determine the coverage of tb laboratory services. the program also developed a facility diagnostic information collection fdic tool and a laboratory diagnostic information collection tool ldic to collect information on bacteriological diagnosis of tb and document usaid tb program south africa 20092015 10 whether appropriate procedures were in place. using these tools, the program can investigate laboratory challenges, share the findings with facility and district staff, develop interventions, and monitor progress through followup site visits. roll out of genexpert rapid tb testing early diagnosis is essential to achieving significant reductions in death and disability as a result of tb and hiv. one of the key objectives of the usaid tb program south africa is to foster early diagnosis through expanded access to new and effective diagnostic technologies. in december 2010, the who endorsed xpert mtb rif genexpert, a rapid testing machine that can simultaneously diagnose tb and detect resistance to rifampicin, one of the most important antitb drugs, in less than 24 hours, and has the potential to greatly reduce the delay between sputum sample collection and treatment initiation for patients with suspected mdrtb this test can also diagnose up to 72 of smear negative pulmonary tb. in an effort to improve the diagnostic capacity for drug susceptible and drug resistant tb, south africa was among the first countries to adopt and implement genexpert as a replacement of smear microscopy for all people presenting with tb symptoms. the usaid tb program south africa partnered closely with the ndoh to facilitate genexpert roll out beginning in march 2011. great acknowledgement to the political support and government investment, south africa now has 289 genexpert machines placed throughout the country the project itself initiated the purchase and placement of 11 genexpert machines in projectsupported districts. since 2011, 3.2 million tb tests have been conduc\",\n          \"zimbabwe final country report march 2007 this publication was produced for review by the united states

zimbabwe final country report vii viii zimbabwe final country report executive summary zimbabwe is in crisis on several fronts, and it is increasingly difficult to implement effective programming. political and economic policies have resulted in hyperinflation, high unemployment, shortages of food and fuel, and widespread hunger and disease. the countrys once excellent public health system is declining, and quality health services are sparse. many international donors have discontinued their development programs, leaving national health interventions underfunded. however, despite the severe economic, political, and health conditions, assistance still moves forward and serves to improve quality of life for those zimbabweans reached by services. zimbabwe has a generalized hivaids epidemic, which ranks as one of the three most severe in the world. in 2004, the aids  tuberculosis tb program of zimbabwes ministry of health and child welfare mohcw estimated the adult prevalence at approximately 24 percent. life expectancy has fallen to 37 years, while infant mortality has more than doubled to 130 per 1,000 live births. the increased morbidity related to aids is stretching scarce health resources at a time when the country is facing enormous economic hardships. since the last quarter of 2003, deliver in zimbabwe has played a key technical assistance role to support the expansion of zimbabwes national antiretroviral therapy art program in the areas of site readiness assessments, quality assurance, logistics management, and condom distribution. working in close collaboration with the mohcw and the united states government usg, delivers original goal in zimbabwe was to improve availability of hivaids condoms in rural health centres and other sites throughout the public sector by helping the znpfc to manage all the logistics functions required to deliver appropriate quantities of condoms on a regular basis. in 2003, the usg began to support the development and rollout of the mohcws national art program in zimbabwe. actual art delivery at four of the five initial sites began in august 2004. in the final year of the project, the u.s. agency for international development usaid mission in zimbabwe asked deliver to expand its portfolio to include technical assistance for art care and treatment at the phase i sites and to the aids  tb program of the mohcw to support expansion of the national art program. this request was unique, as it went beyond the deliver mandate and recognized the expertise of john snow, inc. jsi expertise in improving health service delivery systems and increasing quality of care. improved logistics system and quality of care in zimbabwe, deliver worked in and achieved significant results in three areas of supply chain management 1 supply chain management of hivaids condoms and contraceptives through the znfpc 2 supply chain management of usgfunded antiretrovirals arvs for selected phase i art sites and 3 supply chain management of arvs, opportunistic infection oi drugs, and hiv rapid test kits for the zimbabwe national hiv  aids program. in the final year of the project, the delivery team topping up dttu system achieved 99 percent coverage of 1,600 facilities in zimbabwe. the main indicator for effectiveness of the dttu project is the stockout level. out of the four commodities that were delivered on a full supply basis male condoms, depoprovera, lofemenal, and ovrette, the stockout rates for any one product were less than 3 percent. deliver conducted a study of logistics management in the national program in late 2005 and produced the report zimbabwe hiv  aids logistics system assessment. this report resulted in two additional logisticians being placed in the aids  tb program, and in orders being placed by deliver for three 7ton delivery trucks dedicated to the distribution of hiv and aids commodities. additionally, deliver assisted the national program in creating a procurement and logistics subcommittee of the zimbabwe final country report ix national hiv care and treatment partnership forum. deliver worked with this subcommittee to develop an interim hivaids commodities ordering and distribution subsystem for the national program. deliver staff conducted training in the use of the system at the 50 current art sites. technical assistance to the zimbabwe national antiretroviral therapy program deliver assisted the mohcw to assess more than 50 potential art sites and assisted in training provincial teams to conduct their own site readiness assessment and followup assessments. it has also assisted the first five sites in developing standard operating procedures, and continues to provide technical assistance and other support to these sites. deliver assisted the national program in developing its monthly progress report for site reporting. support for decentralization of hiv care and art for two phase i sites deliver supported the decentralization of hiv care and art in two phase 1 sites to facilitate easier access for patients to services and adherence to hiv care and art, but also to enhance quality of care by decongesting the art initiating sites, reducing patient waiting times for services at these sites, and alleviating travel and transport costs faced by many individuals. deliver is providing support to the district of mazowe with a mobile hiv care and art clinic to ensure uninterrupted art. hiv care and art support have also been provided for stable patients from hospitals in harare city and harare city clinics. in total, 170 providers have been trained in oi and art management. lessons learned from these two models will be used by the national art program for decentralization of hiv care and art services in other rural and urban settings. quality of care delivers contribution to a major art component of the usg has been to monitor the quality of hiv care given to patients by using the jsi quality management program adapted for use in zimbabwe. the tools are being pilottested in mashonaland central province, using a provincial quality monitoring team to be trained with support by deliver. human capacity in logistics through delivers support, human capacity in logistics management was provided in several areas. deliver trained over 76 staff from the znfpc, and projectwide in all of the countrys provinces, on executing dttu loading, delivery runs, and submission of written reports. additionally, there is capacity now within deliver and znfpc head office logistics staff, who are now experienced in organizing and running dttu training seminars. twentyfive individuals from the mohcw, natpharm, the mohcws dps, the centers for disease control and prevention cdc, and the dttu took jsis training course, supply chain management for commodity security, in a special session held in zimbabwe. the special session enabled deliver to facilitate the training of many critical cadres in the logistics system for hivaids commodities in preparation of the rollout of the national hivaids program. in collaboration with family health international, medicines control authority of zimbabwe laboratory technicians were trained to comply with international standards for condomtesting procedures. resource mobilization for commodity security zimbabwe continues to rely on donors for its contraceptive needs. with the application of the brooke alexander amendment, usaid discontinued the provision of contraceptives, except for hivaids condoms for the public sector and social marketing. therefore, the department for international development dfid, through crown agents consultancy, inc., will be providing future contraceptive commodities to the public sector. the very accurate database arising from the deliverdesigned dttu system and the regular completion of contraceptive procurement tables cpts by deliver and the znfpc have allowed these donors to plan for and provide a full supply of the commodities. zimbabwe final country report x forecasting deliver assists the znfpc to prepare cpts annually, and revises them semiannually for the public sector. the partners involved in the exercise are deliver, crown agents consultancy, inc., and the znfpc. information from delivers logistics management information system lmis, logistics data from the znfpc, and supplierrelated data are fed into the pipeline software to forecast future requirements and updated in the second half of the year with actual consumption data to adequately ensure that there are enough stocks in the pipeline. the accuracy of the data in the system has helped ensure that the stock levels stay within the desired minimum and maximum levels. lessons learned over the course of deliver in zimbabwe, change was constant, from the faltering economy to the turnover in personnel. in this environment, the single most significant lesson learned was the necessity of constant coordination between donors and the government of zimbabwe goz and of the ability to react nimbly as priorities shift. for dttu, an essential element has been placing immediate control of resources directly in the hands of donors contractors, rather than with government agencies. in arv procurement and distribution, it was necessary to revise initial assumptions about the projected use of second line regimens and make subsequent changes to the projects initial procurement plans. stakeholder and donor consensus was a critical step in establishing a sustainable, nationwide art care and treatment program. future directions as zimbabwes economic crisis worsens, the goz faces the very real possibility that it will not have the resources to maintain current art patients treatment. in a effort to strengthen the countrys hivaids commodities ordering and distributions system, usaid and dfid have committed to develop an interim management system to strengthen natpharms capacity. within the realm of art treatment support, the usg continues its commitment to the patients in its pilot program and is also supporting the gozs ongoing treatment decentralization program. this should result in a decongesting of the major initiating sites and increase patients access to continuing services. finally, the dttu system will continue in its present form for one to two additional years before being integrated into the essential drugs supply chain. zimbabwe final country report xi zimbabwe final country report xii program background country context zimbabwe has a population of approximately 12 million people united nations 2004 with some 25 percent of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 and an additional 40 percent of the population between the ages of 0 and 14. since 1990, the annual population growth has slowed from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent. the country is currently experiencing fourdigit inflation and extreme levels of poverty. zimbabwe has a generalized hivaids epidemic that ranks as one of the three most severe in the world. in 2004, the aids  tuberculosis tb program of zimbabwes ministry of health and child welfare mohcw estimated the adult prevalence at approximately 24 percent estimates of the number of people infected with hiv range from 1.8 million to 2.3 million out of the countrys total population of 12 million. the number of those who are infected and are currently in need of antiretroviral therapy art is approximately 342,000, including infants and children. the zimbabwe national art program started providing art on a relatively large scale in 2004. as of august 31, 2006, there were 40,710 people on art nationally of these, 34,710 were receiving art through the public sector. of the 34,710 patients receiving art through the public sector, approximately 30,000 are receiving art exclusively through government of zimbabwe goz support. at least 70 percent of hospital beds in medical wards are occupied by patients with aidsrelated conditions. life expectancy has fallen to 37 years, while infant mortality has more than doubled to 130 per 1,000 live births. the increased morbidity related to aids is stretching scarce health resources at a time when the country is facing enormous economic hardships. due to the current harsh economic climate, zimbabwe has been hard hit by a huge exodus of trained staff to other countries. the mohcw health staff complement and vacancy update as of the end of september 2004 indicated 56 percent, 32 percent, and 92 percent, respectively, of the posts for doctors, nurses, and pharmacists respectively are vacant. the vacancy situation tends to be worse in rural areas than in the urban areas, thus increasing the challenges for the scaling up of art. there is no plan to address this situation government of zimbabwe 2005. in 2003, through centers for disease control and prevention cdc initiation, the united states government usg began a joint u.s. agency for international development usaidcdc effort of support for the development and rollout of the mohcws national art program in zimbabwe. actual art delivery at five initial sites began in august 2004. both the cdc and usaid have combined their comparative advantages in the support for this program. since the last quarter of 2003, deliver has played a key technical assistance role to support the expansion of zimbabwes national art program in the areas of site readiness assessments, quality assurance, logistics management, and condom distribution. key players and roles for deliver in zimbabwe to achieve its program objectives over the past three years, it has required the intervention and cooperation of several different organizations. among these are the aids  tb program of the mohcw, zimbabwe national family planning council znfpc, the department of international development dfid, jsiukcrown agents consultancy, inc., the national pharmaceutical corporation natpharm, and the national hiv care and treatment partnership forum. table 1 shows deliver in zimbabwes principal areas of intervention and the primary partner organizations with whom deliver collaborates most closely. zimbabwe

counterpart for the delivery team topping up dttu system, the znfpc works with deliver to implement activities developed for dttu, which distributes condoms and contraceptives nationwide. the znfpc is responsible for communicating and coordinating with its provincial staff, the mohcw, and other stakeholders, and has the important role of service delivery and information, education, and communication. these efforts promote use of the condoms for hivaids prevention and increase condom demand. specifically, the znfpc providesadequate warehousing space for storing the hivaids condoms in the harare and masvingo warehouses to allow for a maximum of 12months supply of condoms and contraceptives at the central level of the system  central and provincial znfpc technical personnel to staff the delivery teams  sufficient office space for deliver staff based at the znfpc in harare and masvingo. jsiuk and crown agents consultancy, inc. through december 2005, jsiuk, through crown agents consultancy, inc., assisted the znfpc with the development of a targeting strategy for the distribution of female condoms and provided financial support to include contraceptives in the hivaids condomdttu delivery system developed by deliver and the znfpc. more specifically crown agents consultancy, inc., was responsible for  providing staff to assist in implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the dttu system  providing per diems, information technology support, and other support for all crown agents consultancy, inc., dttu project staff, as well as a portion of subsistence and travel allowance for znfpc deliveryteam members while conducting deliveries  leasing delivery trucks as necessary, andor providing fuel, maintenance, repair, and general operating costs for delivery trucks and monitoring vehicles purchased by deliver  providing office furniture, equipment, and supplies and other inputs, as appropriate. zimbabwe final country report 2 aids  tb program the aids  tb program of the mohcw is charged with coordinating the implementation of the health sector hivaids response. the program covers several technical areas, including hivaids, tb, sexually transmitted infection, prevention of mothertochild transmission, surveillance, aids at the workplace, and monitoring and evaluation. each area has an assigned technical coordinator. the capacity of the program to ensure commodity security of antiretrovirals arvs and other hivaidsrelated products has been strengthened through the secondment of three logisticians two from deliver, and one from cdc. the aim has been to secure regular forecasting and quantification of hivaids commodities, as well as closely monitor stocks of arv drugs at art sites. however, due to the lack of skilled manpower, these individuals are forced to work on all programmatic areas, rather than concentrate strictly on the logistics requirements of the programs. natpharm natpharms mandate is to manage the supply chain management of all pharmaceuticals for the mohcw, including hivaids commodities. recognizing that the success of the zimbabwe national art program will depend in part on the development and implementation of a strong supply chain management system, deliver in may 2006 conducted an assessment of natpharm and mohcw capacity for supply chain management of hivaids commodities. the mohcw has approved the recommendations of that assessment, and usaid has agreed to fund the implementation of some of those recommendations. hiv national hiv care and treatment partnership forum the national hiv care and treatment partnership forum is a critical structure for communication and coordination vital to the zimbabwes national art rollout. deliver began providing technical and other assistance to the aids  tb program in organizing the art partnership forum in november 2005. deliver and the world health organization who provide financial support for the meetings, and deliver also provides secretariat services. members include usaid and the cdc usg, dfid, unicef, the european union, mdecins sans frontires msf, the elizabeth glaser pediatric aids foundation, zimbabwe association of church hospitals, the national aids control program, united nations agencies, mohcw personnel. and others. the mohcw sets the date, venue, and agenda with input from the group, and uses the email database to send invitations to forum members. the forum meets bimonthly. in addition to these groups, population services international psi implements various hivaids related programs, with funding from usaid and other donors. psi is the lead agency in the social marketing of protector plus condoms and other contraceptives, and also runs a highly successful voluntary counseling and testing program new start. the medicines control authority of zimbabwe mcaz tests and approves all condoms and arv drugs used in the national program. key challenges zimbabwe is in crisis on several fronts, and it is increasingly difficult to implement effective programming. political and economic policies have resulted in hyperinflation, high unemployment, shortages of food and fuel, and widespread hunger and disease. the countrys once excellent public health system is declining, and quality health services are sparse. many international donors have discontinued their development programs, leaving elements of the national health programs underfunded. usaid funding support for public sector family planning programs was discontinued when the brooke alexander amendment sanctions were imposed in january 2002, the brookealexander amendment limits economic assistance when a foreign government defaults on loan payments. usaid assistance to the goz was further restricted in response to the flawed presidential election in march 2002. the hyperinflationary environment deliver is operating in an economic environment that is characterized by fourdigit inflation and a statecontrolled exchange rate regimen. in this environment, zimbabwe final country report 3 project funds are exchanged at the official exchange rate, where they have sometimes fetched as little as 20 percent of the parallel market rate. this has exposed project funds to the hyperinflation that is obtaining in zimbabwe. while recent changes to the currency and easing of the exchange rate were designed to try and alleviate some of the hardship, it has created a new difficulties for zimbabweans, and the economic situation will not improve in the foreseeable future. fuel shortages zimbabwe is operating under a severe fuel shortage environment, mainly due to the shortage of foreign currency. international organizations can use their own foreign currency to import fuel through caltex for use in projects. the caltex facility has been reliable, but fuel is available only in major centers. it is a challenge to make distributions in rural areas, where there are no refuelling facilities. in addition to having an extra fuel tank installed on each delivery truck at the time of purchase, deliver has fitted each truck with a trunk that can carry 10 jerricans in order to increase the distances that the trucks can cover without returning for refueling on delivery runs that require more fuel than the two standard tanks can carry. poor road network although zimbabwe has one of the better road systems in africa outside south africa, during the rainy season some clinics, hospitals, and communitybased distribution workers become inaccessible due to the bad condition of roads. this leads to increased stockouts. antiretroviral therapy the broad challenges with regard to the general operating environment discussed above apply for implementation of art programs. the main challenges specific to the art initiative include  operating in an environment with a very high need for art services  the need to keep adapting to changing mohcw priorities that may not necessarily be in line with the deliver workplan  staff attrition at the five sites and in the other goz areas deliver is supporting  centralization of services in major hospitals, coupled with escalating transportation costs. high unmet need for art the deliver art activities are being implemented in an environment of high unmet need for arvs and art services. it is estimated that between 26,000 and 30,000 zimbabweans are currently on art. this represents less than 10 percent of the zimbabweans with aids who need art today. as an implementer for the usg, it is a challenge for deliver to manage the perception from our partners that the usg could do more to support hiv care and art scaleup and to let them know that the usg is doing as much as it can, given the current environment. need to keep adapting to mohcw priorities deliver provides technical and other support to the national art program. as part of this support, the mohcw has requested significant deliver staff time to assist with the site readiness and followup assessments of the national art sites. deliver has adapted to accommodate this expanding need, while ensuring priority areas in the deliver art workplan also received due attention. very high staff attrition in the health delivery system this is a major challenge for the national art program and also for deliver activities in zimbabwe. staff attrition is very high in zimbabwe because of the poor performance of the economy and aids mortality. this means that there is a continual drain of trained staff, and a continual loss of institutional memory that also affects the programs deliver is supporting. staff shortage and high staff attrition are an increasingly major threat for the sustainability of delivers programs and for future operations. need for decentralization of services. the national rollout plan of hiv care and art has focused largely on scaleup of hiv care and art services through the central, provincial, and district hospitals, zimbabwe final country report 4 depending on their readiness to implement services. there are currently 57 sites, nearly all of them hospitals, offering both art initiation and art followup services. having a national scaleup plan focused on hospitalbased hiv care and art services has meant that most of the patients in care have to travel long distances to access hiv care and art services at the nearest hospital certified to offer the services. however. as zimbabwes economy has continued to experience increasing challenges, many of which have had an impact at the individual level. escalating travel and transport costs, and sometimes unavailability of transport, are negatively affecting patient adherence to clinical care and art nationwide, with potential for adverse public health outcomes for the zimbabwe art program. high hospital consultation fees are also a major disincentive for accessing hospitalbased services, including hiv care and art services for patients, leading to high defaulter rates. additionally, as more and more patients are enrolled, the main art sites initiating patients on art are quickly reaching their saturation capacity. decentralization of hiv care and art services is therefore not only required in order to facilitate easier access to services and adherence to hiv care and art for patients, but also to enhance quality of care by decongesting the art initiating sites and reducing patient waiting times for services at these sites. delivery team topping up the primary challenge for the dttu programs has been dfid funding gaps. from the time that the jsieurope project closed its offices in zimbabwe on 31 december 2005, the flow of dfid funds into the project was erratic and resulted in significant disruptions to the dttu delivery schedule. dfid and crown agents consultancy, inc., are in the process of signing a contract that will continue dttu funding through february 2007. dfid plans to have a new procurement contract in place by that time and that the contractor will be able to purchase contraceptives for the project and channel operational funds into dttu. an additional challenge for dttu was the delays in condom distribution due to mcaz testing standards. some usaidprovided condoms failed mcaz testing, in part because the mcaz was using outdated who testing standards, and in part because of inconsistent testing procedures being used by the mcaz. family health international fhi, usaids contraceptive quality assurance contractor, assessed mcaz testing procedures and recommended training in the united states for two mcaz staff. deliver funded the training. no condoms have failed mcaz testing since that training and the adoption of the most recent who testing standard. zimbabwe final country report 5 zimbabwe final country report 6 goals and

the regional flexible family planning, reproductive health and genderbased violence services for transition situations project was funded by the united states agency for international development usaid and implemented by pathfinder international, in collaboration with intrahealth international. the flexible fpgbv services for transition situations was piloted in burundi and walungu eastern drc. in burundi, as in drc, political crisis generated internally displaced populations idps, refugees camps and returned populations who were at high risk of death and disease from reproductive health disorders and interpersonal violence. the affected populations experienced forced displacement from homes, exposure to violence, poverty and separation from families and communities, all of which significantly disrupted their access to health services, including family planning and reproductive health services. the flexible fpgbv services for transition situations project aimed to produce flexible approaches that can be matched and packaged as models to deliver rhfpgbv services at different phases of crisis as well as pre and post crisis. the project targeted the idps, refugees and populations living in transition situation mainly in muyinga province and walungu the eastern drc. pathfinders proposed models to deliver comprehensive rhfpgbv services for populations affected by crisis included the following menu of options  early planning precrisis and planning at various phases of crises  training a core cadre  establishing mobile outreach teams  providing communitybased distribution of depo provera  setting up 24hour dropin centers  offering post exposure prophylaxis and emergency contraception ec  addressing sexual and genderbased violence including the healthy images of manhood approach him  implementing community advocacyactivities including health promotion and community outreach and  government developing partnerships and coordination with other organizations, including the un and other humanitarian organizations, and local ngos. this report covers the activities and results produced during 4 years of the projects life. 3 participants to the national contingency plan validation workshop in burundi the burundian national contingency plan. ii. activities and results a. plan early and continue planning through each phase one of the approaches piloted was about preparing the response to a crisis before it happens. planning that occurs in advance of a crisis can take place at a slower pace than planning at the onset of an emergency. comprehensive rhfpgbv services need to be established as soon as possible in the stabilizedcomprehensive prevention and response phase after the emergency phase. to do this requires early planning, starting from the emergency preparedness phase, continuing into the midst of emergency, which includes the implementation of the minimum initial service package misp for reproductive health. activities below were implemented by the project in burundi during its fouryear life, the fp project supported updates to the national contingency plan in collaboration with unfpa. for the first time, the misp for the rh component was integrated into the national emergency preparedness plan. at the provincial level, workshops were organized in kayanza and muyinga to update the two provincial contingency plans and incorporate the misp for rh concept. in drc in 2011, the project supported trained srh sexual and reproductive health coordinators on the misp for rh to develop and finalize the misp for rh provincial work plan before its integration into the south kivu province contingency plan. the document was updated in october 2012 and validated at the provincial level. the south kivus misp for rh work plan 4 participants from 15 organizations becoming misp for rh coordinators the work plan developed was presented by the pnsr and validated at the provincial level for future integration into the south kivus provincial contingency plan. b. train a core cadre another program approach is to train a core cadre of program planners and implementers. different types of crises and phases of a crisis require different skill sets and appropriate training. pathfinder identified and trained a core cadre of personnel composed of health and nonhealth providers comprising select key staff and health workers. in burundi during the project, trainings of a core cadre of trainers were conducted in various topics misp, sgbv, and him. trainings were conducted both at the national and provincial levels. a total of 101 trainers were trained in burundi 5 trainers trained on sgbv case management, 50 trainers trained on misp and 46 trainers trained on him. training participants were from both the health sector and nonhealth sector. in drc during the 4 years of implementation, in close collaboration with pnsr department of the provincial moh in the south kivu province, trainings of a core cadre of trainers were conducted on various topics misp, sgbv, him. a total of 54 trainers were trained in south kivu province 5 trainers trained on sgbv case management, 24 trainers trained on misp and 15 trainers trained on him. training participants were from both the health sector and nonhealth sector. srh task force in bukavu, south kivu. october 2012. 5 clients seeking for long acting and permanent fp methods in gasorwe. onsite testimony by an implant beneficiary to public. returnees and idps benefiting from integrated mobile outreach activities c. establish mobile outreach teams this approach, which was piloted in burundi and drc, aimed to complement and supplement services provided by existing clinicsfacilities. planning for an integrated mobile team imt approach can be initiated precrisis or teams can be established at various phases of a crisis, including the postcrisis recovery phase. the accomplishments are described below in burundi the imt approach started in 2011, with the implementation of the strategy requiring close collaboration with official authorities health and administration and with various implementing partners. the project signed 2 mous one with abubef and another with kayanza health district, defining roles, responsibilities and mechanisms of effective and strategic co implementation of the integrated activities. the range of services offered in the imt outreach activities were  family planning services services offered during imt include long acting fp methods implants and iud, contraceptive side effect management, oral contraceptives, condoms male and female, and pills. o o  genderbased violence prevention and case management during imt activities, gbv services were offered. survivors of genderbased violence received clinical and psycho social services ec, pep, hivaids testing, etc.. also sensitization and community mobilizationorientation events were organized for all the attendants. 6 children captivated by a longer singer screening process in gasorwe  hiv testing and sti case management clients for hiv testing benefit oneonone counseling and testing. clients receiving sti treatment also benefit from counseling during and after medical consultation.  anc and post natal care imt sessions were the opportunity for pregnant women to benefit from antenatal care and post natal care for those who recently delivered. these services were offered either by nurses, midwives or other trained health workers. it should be noted that, pregnant women presenting danger signs were referred to the nearest health centerhospital andor specific appointments set up for delivery with skilled birth attendants and in a secure place health centers or hospitals, depending on the identified signs.  nutrition another new element into the imt services is nutrition at the community level. this was done in collaboration with the mch projecttrained mamans lumires illuminating mothers and chws trained on imci. this approach has proven to be the most effective entry point for fp services. indeed, through these nutrition activities, mothers, while taking care of their children, not only received key messages on family planning but they also had the chance to discuss with health providers and chw about fp methods and ultimately adopted their preferred method. women waiting for ancpnc. 7 trained chw offering malaria testing  malaria the homebased management of malaria aiming to reduce malaria related deaths by timely screening and treating children is a strategy piloted by the pathfinder internationalmch project in the same provinces. during imt sessions, trained chws provided malaria testing and treatment to children. mothers were also provided with adequate counseling on malaria prevention and appropriate use of bed nets but also connecting those mothers to other services including reproductive health family planning, gender based violence, hivaidssti and nutrition. as a result, 3 imt were established and 22 sessions were conducted in kayanza and muyinga. during these imt sessions, achievements include indicator total achieved people reached 11003 implants inserted 54 dmpa offered 90 condoms distributed 795 hiv tests 1325 nutrition screening for under five 1588 sti treatment 173 malaria testing 195 in drc the project started piloting imt in drc from 2011 up to the end of the project and activities were conducted in walungu and miti health zones. details of the integrated package offered in south kivu region are listed below  family planning fp service offered by the integrated mobile team in the south kivu region includes 1 fp counseling and 2 service provision that includes pregnancy testing, contraceptive administration and side effect management. as mentioned above, the imt also integrate the long acting fp in addition to those already provided at the community level.  genderbased violence prevention and case management gbv prevention and case management are part of the integrated service package offered during the imt activities. if cases of sgbv existed, survivors received clinical and psychosocial services including emergency contraception ec, post exposure prophylaxis pep, hivaids testing, as 8 awareness session during an imt activity in miti health zone south kivu, drc appropriate. often, community mobilization and sensitization were organized targeting gbv survivors.  hiv testing and sti case management clients requesting hiv testing received personalized counseling before any testing and those who tested positive were referred accordingly for case management. those receiving sti treatment also benefited from counseling during medical consultation.  antenatal care and post natal care during the imt activities, women received antenatal and postnatal care from the teams technicians who were medical doctors, nurses, midwives. counseling was given to client or couple on fp methods and educational materials were made available on site to help with htsp.  nutrition this service was offered in walungu and mitimurhesa health zones by the hospital staff leader in collaboration with volunteer mothers from the community. using local resources and crops, there were a cooking demonstration showing different ways to mix ingredients to improve and maintain good nutritional status the session was also accompanied by nutritional screening targeting mainly children under five.  medical consultation a gp from the referral general hospital was made available during the imt outreach for outpatients in consultations as well as referred cases from the nearby health centers, especially for those clients living at significant distance from hospitals. the gp also received clients in need of help beyond the capacity of health center technicians. with 2 imt established, a total of 26 sessions of imt were conducted in drc. during these imt sessions, achievements were as below indicator total achieved people reached 7000 dmpa offered 35 condoms distributed 632 hiv tests 225 nutrition screening for under five 1652 sti treatment 159 onsite medical consultation 444 9 cbd agents equipped

community health workers can safely provide fp methods including injectable contraceptives and insure access to the full range of fp methods to populations in transitional situations. community distribution of fp methods takes the service to populations cut off from facilitybased services. in this axis, the project realized the below activities in burundi during the 4 years, sessions of trainings for cbd agents and supervisors were organized in the two provinces of projects intervention zone. a total of 104 cbd agents and 40 supervisors were trained to cover 10 project sites. trainers were from the pnsr and provincial level and the training manual used was the national guide for chws. formative supervisions were also conducted by the fp project with health districts supervisors and monthly workshops were organized. one of the monthly workshops objectives was to develop provincial ownership. the achievements from the burundi cbd activities are shown in the table

cbd activities in drc a total of 189 cbd agents in drc 97 from walungu and 92 from miti were trained, including 55 offering dmpa. trained cbd agents were equipped with a cbd kit, accessories for hand washing, raincoats, boots and management tools register, client cards, and calendar. the walungu cdb agents received bicycles to facilitate their transportation within their communities. in total 91 bicycles were distributed to 91 chws in the walungu health zone by the fp project. the distribution was directly managed by the walungu health zone authorities for future followup. joint formative supervisions of cbd activities were conducted in walungu and miti health zones with the rh provincial department and monthly workshops were organized with the objectives to 1 refresh cbds on communication and technical skills as well as enhance experience exchange, 2 resupply cbds and 3 compile the data collected by these cbds. achievements from the drc cbd activities are shown in the

important respond to emergency rhfp needs of all women, including survivors of sexual and genderbased violence. considering the high hiv prevalence and incidence of rape in communities living in transitional situations, pep and ec are critical services. the gaps in equipment and need to renovate health facilities made establishing these 24hour dropin services even more challenging. 11 the fpgbv project accomplished a varied range of activities in burundi while piloting approaches for 4 years, health facilities benefited medical and nonmedical equipment and supplies including but not limited to solar panels, delivery kits, and height measuring scales, stethoscopes, iud kits, hospital beds and plain foam mattresses, infant incubators to insure that 24 hour services are functional. the project also supported people from mugano for the rehabilitation of mugano health center which was transformed in a district hospital. the fp project supported with fuel, kayanza and muyinga in twoway referral system, a critical aspect in managing emergencies, to ensure a fluid and working reference mechanism between communities and health center through chws, the health centers and the referral hospitals. referred clients include emergency obstetrical cases and clients from remote communities in need of special care. the fp project organized training workshops for health providers on gbv case management in order to offer emergency services 24 hours a day. a total of 35 health providers from kayanza and muyinga were trained on sgbv clinical care, in collaboration with seruka. a total of 35 sgbv providers trained by the fp project continue to assist survivors in muyinga and kayanza. formative supervisions were carried out by the fp project. the project organized a training of trainers on sgbv case management for 5 selected providers who were previously trained on sgbv case management. the project proposed to update the sgbv manual and an addendum was produced and submitted to the pnsr for use and appropriation. the project supported the pnsr to organize a workshop to integrate the addendum in sgbv training manual. currently the sgbv training manual is updated thanks to the projects support. from trainings, renovation and equipment benefited, the 12 health centers and hospital reported having received more than 300 sgbv survivors where they received care including emergency contraception ec and psychosocial care from nurses trained on sgbv case management by the project. twentyfour hour dropin services are also functional in the 12 health facilities. 12 izirangabo health center before rehabilitation izirangabo health center after rehabilitation burhale health center after rehabilitation one bloc burhale health center before rehabilitation in drc five health facilities were renovated by the project to enable them to offer 24hour dropin services. these facilities are walungu hospital, kidodobo, burhale, bideka. also, the project equipped 26 health facilities in medical and nonmedical equipment and supplies including but not limited to solar panels, delivery kits, and height measuring scales, stethoscopes, iud kits, hospital beds and plain foam mattresses, all to insure availability of services 24hours a day. 13 follow up sessions were conducted by the fp project to evaluate quality of services in the health facilities that were renovated. burhale and izirangabo health facilities were visited in the drc and it was noticed that  equipment distributed is being used to meet the needs of population  service provision and fpgbv service uptake are improving  the number of clients seeking care has increased. the fp project supported kayanza and muyinga with fuel for the twoway referral system, a critical aspect in managing emergencies, and ensuring a fluid and working referral mechanism between communities and health center through chws, the health centers and the referral hospitals. referred clients include emergency obstetrical cases and clients from remote communities in need of special care. the fp project also organized training on sgbv case management for health providers to offer 24 hours services. a total of 30 providers attended the training. the project also organized a training of trainers on sgbv case management for 5 selected providers who were previously trained on sgbv case management. the trainings, renovation and equipment donations, enabled health centers and hospitals to report having received around 80 sgbv survivors who received care including ec and psychosocial care from nurses trained on sgbv case management by the project. twentyfour hour dropin service is also operational in partner health facilities. f. address gender issues in transitional situations, women dont have the same access to power structures and material resources. also, the breakdown of social networks and institutions, the loss of means of livelihood, and the weakness of social and sexual norms increase the vulnerability of girls and women to sexual and genderbased violence. in order to preventaddress those issues, the fp project implemented the successful him approach. in burundi during the 4 years, him activities were mainly conducted in gasorwe. a training of trainers session on him was conducted in gasorwe commune. a total of 13 participants were present during the 5day training. these participants included staffs from the administration department of muyinga province, administration of gasorwe commune and the moh. 14 view of participants religious leaders in muyinga after the him training the fp project conducted also 5day him trainings for each of the 11 selected collines for him activities in gasorwe, burundi. a total of 331 participants attended the him trainings. the

fp project staffs were invited to participate in meetings organized by other partners to review activities and explore synergies. moreover, as most of the activities offered in imt were not included in the fp project scope of work, coordination mechanisms were established with the pathfinder internationalburundi mch project. also 2 formal mous were concluded one with abubef and another with kayanza health district defining roles and responsibilities and mechanisms of effective and strategic coimplementation of the integrated activities. joint supervisions initiated by the fp project and health districts supervisors were conducted with the objective to assess the level of collaboration between cbds and health centers, to reinforce cbd agents capacity and to support health districts to develop ownership of the activity by monitoring cbd activities by themselves during other health centers activities. a successful collaboration and negotiation with unfpa resulted on the provision of more than 1000 fp charts to distribute in different health facilities. in drc during the projects life in drc, the fp project supported the walungu general hospital by making available tools and medical equipment for improving the quality of care offered to victims of sgbv. the delivery maternity ward benefited from partograms, clean water and electricity source via generator. the fp project continued strengthening the walungu referral system and the ambulance functioning by providing support on fuel. also 2 formal mous were concluded one with walungu health zone, one with miti health zone and another with bdd defining roles and responsibilities and mechanisms of effective and strategic partnership. nairobi fp meeting, burundi gallery walks, july 2011 mou with abubef mou with walungu health zone 18 joint formative supervisions of cbd activities were conducted in walungu and miti health zones with the rh provincial department and health zones supervisors to strengthened

and lessons learned during the implementation of the fp project, pathfinder international faced the following challenges but also learned some lessons challenges  insufficient skilled personnel to update contingency plans. this was a big issue to update contingency plans in a timely way  mobility of the personnel the fp project trained people who were transferred to other places out of our intervention area  national decision makers who were far from intervention area in drc was a big issue for documents update which took longer than planned  the success of the imt required the use of mobile clinic car, which was not available within the fp project. this was solved by using district ambulances in kayanza and drc and a mobile clinic car provided by abubef in muyinga  health policies did not allow chws to offer injectable contraceptives. in burundi, this was solved by referring clients in need of injectable methods to the nearest health facility. in drc, unemployed nurses were

It could indicate that Democratic reports give more importance to ‘reproductive health’ in the context of family planning than Republican reports. Comparing the themes of the divergent NNs can also be insightful. The Democratic embedding contains six keywords out of seven mentioning ‘health’, and only one mention of the word ‘family’. On the other hand, the Republican embedding includes two times the word 'health' and five the word 'family'. This difference in frequencies may reflect divergent ideological priorities, general health being emphasized on the Democratic side and topics related to family on the Republican side."
